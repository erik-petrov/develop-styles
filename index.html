          <h5 class="card-title">Behavior-driven</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, quality assurance testers, and customer representatives in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.</div>

          <h5 class="card-title">Design-driven</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Design driven development uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to build better, more informed technology solutions. It can also be looked at as a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application. This leads to products that people enjoy using and want to tell others about.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Domain-driven</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Domain-driven design articulates a number of high-level concepts and practices. Of primary importance is domain, the subject area to which the user applies a program is the domain of the software. A software's domain governs its context, the setting in which a word or statement appears that determines its meaning. From this, developers build a domain model: a system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain. These aspects of domain-driven design aim to foster ubiquitous language, meaning that the domain model should form a common language shared by domain experts for describing system requirements, business users, sponsors and developers. </p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Secure by design</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Secure by design means that software engineers have designed the software to be secure from the outset so as to reduce the likelihood of flaws that might compromise a company's information security. </p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Test-driven</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases before developing the actual code.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Acceptance test-driven</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Acceptance Test-Driven Development, or ATDD, is a software development methodology, often associated with agile methodologies, that fosters collaboration between developers, testers and business stakeholders, and in which test automation plays a major role.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Continuous test-driven</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Continuous test-driven development (CTDD) is a software development practice that extends test-driven development (TDD) by means of automatic test execution in the background, sometimes called continuous testing.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Specification by example</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Specification by example (SBE) is a collaborative approach to defining requirements and business-oriented functional tests for software products based on capturing and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Data-driven</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Data-driven design is a design technique in object-oriented programming, which improves encapsulation by using the clientâ€“server model. It focuses on the contract by considering the actions that the object is responsible for and the information that the object shares.</p>
